<h2>The Apple</h2>
<p>Look! There is an apple. <br>It's a big, juicy apple. <br>Daddy, I want that apple. <br> Mmm... It's too high to reach. <br>I have a good idea.</p>
<p>Little more, daddy, little more. <br>I can't reach it! It's too high! <br> Stand on your tiptoes! <br>I have another idea.</p>
<p>I've almost got it, daddy. <br>You're very heavy! <br>Chip, be careful! Ok. Uh...</p>
<p>I've got it. Oh, no... <br>The apple is falling!</p>
<p>Catch it, mommy! <br>Oops, catch it, Biff! <br>Oop, catch it, Kipper! <br>Oh,no... <br>Woo...Woo...</p>
<p>Floppy is eating the apple! <br>Oh,no, Floppy... <br>It looks so yummy. <br> Ha.ha.ha, you're lucky, Floppy.</p>
